# 2024-NOS-Code-Package_v3.6.0

This repository contains version 3.6.0 of the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS) National Operational Coastal Modeling Program (NOCMP) code package for delivery to
the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediciton (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO) for the next production implementation at
NOAA’s Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing System (WCOSS2).

**NOTE: Due to file size limitations on GitHub, the fix directory was not uploaded.  Refer to the Implementation Instructions Section in the nosofs.v3.6.0 Release
Notes for the location of the fix directory.**

## Overview
NOS develops and operates Operational Forecast Systems (OFS) that provide users with nowcast (analyses of near-present) and forecast guidance of water levels,
currents, salinity and water temperature out to 120 hours, four times per day. The OFS are operated under a standardized Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF)
at NOAA’s WCOSS.

OFSs are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and will join the NOS' operational
oceanographic capabilities to form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling. Currently, NOS operates a
network of 15 OFS located along the coastal United States, including:
* Alaska (Cook Inlet)
* West Coast (Salish Sea and Columbia River, San Francisco Bay, West Coast)
* East Coast (St. Jonhs River, Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, New York, Gulf of Maine)
* Gulf of Mexico (Tampa Bay and Northern Gulf of Mexico)
* Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Lake Michigan-Huron, Lake Ontario, Lake Superior)
